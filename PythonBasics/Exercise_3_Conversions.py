## The distance from LA to NYC in miles
distance_miles = 2806
## Distance in Km. 1 mile = 1.609 km
distance_km = distance_miles * 1.609


## Temperature in degreese Celsius
temperature_c = 25
## The temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Celsius (°C) times 9/5 plus 32
## Temperature in Fahrenheit
temperature_f = ((temperature_c * 9/5) + 32)

## Size in inch
inch = 17
## 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters
## Size in cm
cm = inch * 2.54

## 1 Year has 365 days, 1 day has 24h, 1h has 3600 sec
year_in_seconds = 365 * 24 * 3600
